                <h2>About Blood Donation</h2>
                <p>Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save the lives of others. There are several types of blood donation, which help meet different medical needs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Whole Blood Donation:</strong> This is the most common type of blood donation, where you donate about a pint of blood.</li>
                    <li><strong>Platelet Donation:</strong> Platelets are cells in your blood that help with clotting. This type of donation is done through a process called apheresis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plasma Donation:</strong> Plasma is the liquid part of your blood. Plasma donation is also done through apheresis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Double Red Cell Donation:</strong> This allows you to safely donate two units of red cells during one donation while your plasma and platelets are returned to you.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Testing blood for infectious diseases</li>
                    <li>Typing blood for transfusion compatibility</li>
                    <li>Storing blood and blood products</li>
                    <li>Distributing blood to hospitals and clinics</li>
